If a user input address is not equal to a constant, and if the amount sent is not equal to a constant, cancel the transaction and revert.
If a user input address is not equal to a constant, and if the amount sent is equal to a constant, and if a user input value is not equal to a constant, and if a calculated value using a user input value is not greater than or equal to another calculated value using another user input value, cancel the transaction and revert.
If a user input address is equal to a constant, and if a user input value is not equal to a constant, and if a calculated value using a user input value is not greater than or equal to another calculated value using another user input value, cancel the transaction and revert.
If a user input address is equal to a constant, and if a user input value is equal to a constant, and if a calculated value using a user input value is not greater than or equal to another calculated value using another user input value, cancel the transaction and revert.
If a user input address is equal to a constant, and if a user input value is equal to a constant, and if a calculated value using a user input value is greater than or equal to another calculated value using another user input value, and if a user input address is not equal to a constant, then the function calculates an amount using a user input value and a timestamp. If this amount is greater than constant, and if a user input address is not equal to zero, then the function transfers this amount of tokens from a user input address to another user input address. If a user input address is not equal to a constant, and if a user input value is equal to a constant, the function calculates a second amount using the first amount, and then transfers this amount of tokens to a third-party address specified by the contract owner.

This directory contains some important artifacts for Uniswap V2, which is one of the largest marketplaces for cryptocurrency exchange.

Uniswap V2 implements a token exchange logic.

1. UniswapV2Pair.sol 

This is the source code of the underlying smart contract, in which token exchange logic is implemented in the `swap` function (L159). To simulate the whole process of exchanging tokens utilizing Uniswap, we implemented the `tradeToken` function (L202).

2. logic.pdf
This is the logic of `tradeToken` function and `swap` function.

3. graph_swap.png
This is a funds transfer graph for the swap function. It contains two transfers. Both of the transfer flows trade the token from an outside account into the user's account.

4. graph_trdeToken.png
This is a funds transfer graph for the customized tradeToken function. It first transfers user-specified tokens out from the user's account to the contract, then grants permission to Uniswap, and finally calls the swap function to trade tokens into the user's account."
